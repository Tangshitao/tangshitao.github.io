I have been a Ph.D student at The Ohio State University since Autumn 2019. I am fortunately working with [Prof. Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io). My current research interest is situated in natural language processing, with focus on semantic parsing and knowledge base. 
Specifically, topics I am interested in include:
* Natural language interface, including semantic parsing, KBQA, etc.
* Representation learning for knowledge bases, including KB embedding, knowledge-aware language modeling, etc.

Previously, I also worked on semantic web with [Prof. Gong Cheng](http://ws.nju.edu.cn/~gcheng) at Nanjing University, during when I developed broad interest in topics related to knowledge-based semantic search (e.g., association search and relevance search) and knowledge-based reasoning (e.g., approximate reasoning in formal logic using GNN).
