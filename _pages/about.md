I am a Ph.D. candidate supervised by [Prof. Yasutaka Furukawa](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~furukawa/) at Simon Fraser University. I also, fortunately, complete my master's study under the supervision of [Prof. Ping Tan](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~pingtan/). My current research interest is 3D vision, generative model, localization and mapping. <span style="color:red">I am currently on job market and will graduate in 2024, looking for full-time positions in industrial. My next target is to build video generation system like [sora](https://openai.com/sora).</span>I have some ideas about how to improve sora. Contact me if you are interested in my work.
