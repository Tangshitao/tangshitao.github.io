I have been a Ph.D student at The Ohio State University since Autumn 2019. I am fortunately working with [Prof. Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io). My current research interest is situated in natural language processing, with focus on semantic parsing and knowledge base. Previously, I also worked on semantic web with [Prof. Gong Cheng](http://ws.nju.edu.cn/~gcheng), so I am also broadly interested in topics related to knowledge-based semantic search and knowledge-based reasoning.
Specifically, topics I am interested include:
* Natural language interface to knowledge base, including semantic parsing, KBQA, e.t.c.
* Representation learning for knowledge base, including KB embedding, knowledge-aware language modeling, e.t.c.
* Search over KB, including graph search (see. [my previous work](http://ws.nju.edu.cn/association/summ2018/wise18_extended.pdf)) and graph mining (see. [my previous work](http://ws.nju.edu.cn/relevance/relsue/relsue-wsdm2019-cr.pdf)), e.t.c.
