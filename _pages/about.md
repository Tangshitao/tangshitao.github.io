I am a research scientist at NVIDIA Research, [Deep Imagination Group](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/). I receive my Ph.D. from Simon Fraser University, supervised by [Prof. Yasutaka Furukawa](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~furukawa/). I also, fortunately, complete my master's study under the supervision of [Prof. Ping Tan](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~pingtan/). My current research interest is world models. <span style="color:red">
